# swift-behave
Behaviour-driven testing framework on top of the Xcode UI Tests that allows to define acceptance tests using a natural language that all team members understand.

**Given** you have a lot of test cases created with [JBehave](http://www.jbehave.org)  
**When** you want to use these test cases with Xcode UI Tests  
**Then** you should give _swift-behave_ a try  

## Roadmap

* "Playback" plain text files that define test cases in the Given/When/Then form.
  * Create a simple test app to demonstrate how swift-behave works
* Gather test execution information and present results
* Build some level of IDE integration with Xcode
